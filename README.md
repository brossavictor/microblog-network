This project, inspired by <img src="https://www.freepnglogos.com/uploads/twitter-logo-png/twitter-logo-vector-png-clipart-1.png" width="16" height="16" alt="twitter logo" />Twitter, was created to test and expose my talents in web developing.


BACK-END:

üõ† Technologies

The back-end was done with <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/816/1*mn6bOs7s6Qbao15PMNRyOA.png" width="16" height="16" alt="ts logo"/> Typescript.
</br>
The database of choice was <img src="https://cdn.cdnlogo.com/logos/f/48/firebase.svg" width="16" height="16" alt="twitter logo"/> Google Firebase.

‚öô Functions

Users can post whatever they want on the website be it a thought or a image or even both.
It is a very rapid and fun social network. Users can be followed and share with their followers their insights and follow other users to get on their own feed reel what people they follow are posting!

‚úçüèº CRUD

The user can <b>create</b> a new post whenever it pleases them. In the alpha version there is no limitations on characters per post. Posts can be uploaded with an image.

Users will <b>read</b> on their feed the posts uploaded by whom they follow. Users can also go to specific profiles and <b>read</b> only the posts uploaded by the profile they wanted to see.

If a user does not want to keep a post for whatever reason, they can <b>delete</b> it whenever it suits them.

For now, there is no feature to update uploads. It may be added in the future.


üîê LogIn

The application offers security to the users. Only the user can upload from their account, delete posts or even delete their own account. For this, theres always a unique login and password.
</br>
To achieve this an authentication JSON web token is needed in order to do all actions. The cryptography put in place will assure security in all aspects.

FRONT-END:

For now, the front-end is still a work in progress.
